Game Description Prompt

Flappy Duck Hunter is a fast-paced, stylized arcade game that blends classic Flappy Bird–style flight with unexpected multi-phase gameplay.

The game features a bold, high-contrast brutalist / neo-arcade visual style: thick black outlines, flat colors, minimal shading, and exaggerated UI elements. The main character is a simple, geometric bird (duck-like), drawn as a chunky square with expressive eyes and a bright beak.

Core Gameplay
	1.	Phase 1 – Flight
	•	Tap-to-fly vertical obstacle course.
	•	The bird navigates through pipes while gravity pulls it down.
	•	Gameplay is precise, fast, and unforgiving.
	•	Player actions are recorded.
	2.	Phase 2 – Hunt
	•	The recorded flight is replayed automatically.
	•	The player now aims and shoots at the replayed bird with a crosshair.
	•	Limited fire rate and strict timing.
	•	Hitting the bird ends the run successfully; missing until replay ends fails the run.
	3.	Optional Phase – Recall / Puzzle
	•	During flight, colored elements appear in a sequence.
	•	After action phases, the player must recall and reorder the sequence.
	•	Accuracy affects the final score.

Game Modes (Examples)
	•	Chicken Mode: controls or gravity randomly reverse for short bursts.
	•	Greedy Bird Mode: collect pellets to score, but the bird grows larger and heavier, increasing difficulty.
	•	Modes can stack for chaotic, high-skill runs.

Visual Themes
	•	Randomized parallax backgrounds per run:
	•	Dystopian futuristic wasteland
	•	Neon city skyline
	•	Techno festival / rave grid
	•	Retro arcade sunset
	•	Subtle animation, strong silhouettes, pixel-perfect or vector-clean look.

Progression & Customization
	•	Hatchable eggs unlock new bird designs.
	•	Cosmetic-only birds and effects.
	•	Custom bird editor allowing players to design and share birds.
	•	No realism; exaggerated, playful, arcade-first design.

Tone
	•	Energetic, slightly absurd, skill-focused.
	•	Feels like a modern arcade cabinet translated to mobile and web.
	•	Designed for replayability, mastery, and visual impact.

⸻

If you want, I can also provide:
	•	A one-paragraph ultra-minimal prompt (for image generators)
	•	A style-only visual prompt
	•	Or separate prompts for UI, characters, backgrounds, and VFX

Just tell me how you plan to use it next.

	•	Switch from aspect-video to dynamic portrait scaling (9:16).
	•	Lock orientation on mobile; optimize hit areas for thumbs.
	•	Move score/phase UI to top and bottom safe zones (not corners).
	•	One-Hand Gameplay
	•	Phase 1: tap anywhere.
	•	Phase 2: optional auto-follow crosshair with tap-to-shoot.
	•	Performance
	•	Reduce per-frame allocations (reuse objects, predefine arrays).
	•	Cap replay buffer size using downsampling (every N frames).

⸻

2. Core Gameplay Extensions
	•	Coins System
	•	Floating coins between pipes.
	•	Risk–reward placement near pipe edges.
	•	Coins affect:
	•	Score multiplier
	•	Unlocks (skins, themes, modes)
	•	Mines / Hazards
	•	Slow-moving mines or lasers in Phase 1.
	•	Phase 2: missed shots can trigger mines → instant failure.
	•	Dynamic Difficulty
	•	Pipe speed, gap size, and spawn frequency scale with time.
	•	Optional “pressure mode” where gravity slowly increases.

⸻

3. New Game Mode: Memory / Puzzle Phase (Highly Recommended)

Phase 3 – RECALL
	•	During Phase 1:
	•	Pipes (or eggs on pipes) are colored in a sequence.
	•	Sequence length scales with flight duration.
	•	After Phase 2:
	•	Player enters a static puzzle screen.
	•	Task: reorder colored duck eggs in the same sequence.
	•	Scoring Impact
	•	Correct sequence → bonus multiplier.
	•	Partial recall → reduced bonus.
	•	Failure → score penalty or no bonus.
	•	Design Advantage
